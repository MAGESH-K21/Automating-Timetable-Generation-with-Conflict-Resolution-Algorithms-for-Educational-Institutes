--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            Usage Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Login using the "dean"(admin) account. You will be redirected to the
  "Manage Timetables" page.

* Create a timetable by clicking on the drop-down on top, beside "Configure
  Timetable:"

* Add departments, faculty, courses and rooms.

* HOD of every department can create courses and allocate timetables for all
  faculty of his/her department.

* Faculty is the account with the least set of privileges: creating courses and
  managing, the timetable for his courses. These privileges are shared by the
  HOD and dean as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Viewing the timetable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The timetable can be viewed by two groups of users:

* Public/guest users (like students):
 - Without needing any login, guest users can either visit the application
   web-root to view the timetable by applying filters on their own, or by
   visiting the links generated by faculty.
 - When they visit the web-root, only the current active timetable is displayed
   by default. As before, users can further apply the various filters such to
   find what they need.
 - The system also displays a link based on these filters which can be
   saved/bookmarked by them for direct display of the filtered timetable.

* Authorized users (Faculty/HOD/Dean):
  - Once authenticated faculty can view, generate links and download snapshots
    for all instances of the timetable, with any set of filters applied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Manage Timetable Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Multiple instances of timetable can be created. While creating a new
  timetable, number of slots, working days and starting time can be configured.

* In a authenticated users can easily manage timetable with the help of the
  intuitive GUI and instructions that accompany.

* Timetables can be frozen by a dean at any time when a finalized timetable is
  needed. It can be used if you want to avoid any accidental changes on the 
  timetable once finalized. A frozen timetable cannot be edited unless a dean
  choses to de-freeze it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Backup/Restore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The system allows the dean to download a whole backup of the database.

* System can be restored to the previous state by uploading the backup file
  back.
